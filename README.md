In this workshop, we will focus on the concept of fine-tuning in machine learning. The objective is to provide a detailed exploration of how pre-trained models can be adapted to new, related tasks. We will cover the methodology, best practices, and potential applications of fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning and embedding are two popular methodologies in machine learning, and they have different purposes and implementations. Here are their differences:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Fine-tuning**: This involves adjusting the weights of an already trained model to make it more suited for a new, but related task. Fine-tuning is especially common in transfer learning, where a model trained on one dataset is used as a starting point for training on a different dataset.
   - **Embedding**: Embeddings are a way to represent categorical or sequential data in a continuous vector space. They are often used to transform discrete data, such as words in natural language processing, into vectors that can be processed by neural networks.

2. **Application Areas**:
   - **Fine-tuning**: Commonly used in transfer learning scenarios, like using a pre-trained image classification model for a related but distinct classification task.
   - **Embedding**: Widely used in NLP for word representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.) and in recommendation systems for representing items and users.

3. **Training**:
   - **Fine-tuning**: Starts with pre-trained weights and modifies them. Depending on the dataset and problem, only the top layers might be fine-tuned while keeping the lower layers fixed, or the entire network might be trained.
   - **Embedding**: Typically, embeddings are trained from scratch using methods like skip-gram or CBOW for words. However, embeddings can also be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for a specific task.

4. **Representation**:
   - **Fine-tuning**: Doesn't change the representation of the input data. It modifies the model to better align with the new data/task.
   - **Embedding**: Converts discrete data into continuous vectors, thus fundamentally changing its representation.

5. **Output**:
   - **Fine-tuning**: The output is usually task-specific, like class probabilities for classification tasks.
   - **Embedding**: The output is a continuous vector in a defined vector space.

6. **Dimensionality**:
   - **Fine-tuning**: Depends on the architecture of the model and the specific layer.
   - **Embedding**: The dimensionality of the embedding space is a hyperparameter, often chosen based on the dataset size and problem complexity.

In essence, while fine-tuning revolves around adapting pre-trained models to new tasks, embedding focuses on converting discrete data into a format that can be easily processed by machine learning models.

- Behavior: Fine-tuning can train an LLM's attitude, behavior or custom output format. 
- Information: Vector embedding can impart data that the LLM doesn't otherwise have access to.
